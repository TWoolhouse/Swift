// =========================Basic Operators in Swift=========================

// An operator is using symbols (like maths) between 1 or 2 data-types
// Maths has 1 + 2
// Swift has more

var i1: Int = 1
var i2: Int = 2

print(i1 + i2)

// Addition operator between two 'Int's

// I won't go through all the maths operations because they are quite self explanatory
// but I will list them

// Operators for Int & Double
// +: Addition
// -: Subtraction
// *: Multiplication
// /: Division
